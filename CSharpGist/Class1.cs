    Instruction:
    Write a function that takes in as an argument a string representation of a binary number whose maximum amount is (2^8)-1.
    This function must return a string matching this format except the first half should be the exact opposite of the second half.

// Number should be 256-1 in binary represented as a string. First half of this number in binary should be the exact opposite of the second half in binary.
// Assuming opposite means all "1's" should be "0's" and vice versa.
